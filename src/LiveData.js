Massive potential exists for using aerial imagery combined with\\ncomputer vision algorithms to assess damage and reduce the potential danger to\\nhuman life. In collaboration with multiple disaster response agencies, xBD\\nprovides pre- and post-event satellite imagery across a variety of disaster\\nevents with building polygons, ordinal labels of damage level, and\\ncorresponding satellite metadata.

Since\\nflight conditions (and most important flight safety) are greatly affected by\\nweather, drone operators need a more accurate localized weather map reading for\\nthe flight area. In this paper, we present the Arduino Sensor Integrated Drone\\n(ASID) with a built-in meteorological station that logs the weather conditions\\nin the vertical area where the drone will be deployed. ASID is an autonomous\\ndrone-based system that monitors weather conditions for pre-flight preparation.\\nThe operation of the ASID system is based on the Arduino microcontroller\\nrunning automatic flight profiles to record meteorological data such as\\ntemperature, barometric pressure, humidity, etc. The Arduino microcontroller\\nalso takes photos of the horizon for an objective assessment of the visibility,\\nthe base, and the number of clouds.","text_path":"","download_failure":"Extract tar.gz failure","search_string":"weather"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14813v1":{"publish_dt":"2021-11-29 18:57:09+00:00","title":"TransWeather: Transformer-based Restoration of Images Degraded by Adverse Weather Conditions","authors":["Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu","Rajeev Yasarla","Vishal M. Patel"],"categories":["cs.CV"],"abstract":"Removing adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow from images is\\nan important problem in many applications. Most methods proposed in the\\nliterature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of\\ndegradation. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural architecture search\\n(All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once.\\nHowever, it has a large number of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to\\ncater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improvement in its\\nperformance. In this work, we focus on developing an efficient solution for the\\nall adverse weather removal problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a\\ntransformer-based end-to-end model with just a single encoder and a decoder\\nthat can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Specifically, we\\nutilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to\\nenhance attention inside the patches to effectively remove smaller weather\\ndegradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather\\ntype embeddings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. TransWeather\\nachieves significant improvements across multiple test datasets over both\\nAll-in-One network as well as methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. In\\nparticular, TransWeather pushes the current state-of-the-art by +6.34 PSNR on\\nthe Test1 (rain+fog) dataset, +4.93 PSNR on the SnowTest100K-L dataset and\\n+3.11 PSNR on the RainDrop test dataset.

Here a low-order model of weathering and\\nclimate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine\\nclimate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions.

The evolution of\\nfloods within networks can be captured based on three macroscopic\\ncharacteristics-flood propagation rate ($\\\\beta$), flood incubation rate\\n($\\\\alpha$), and recovery rate ($\\\\mu$)-in a system of ordinary differential\\nequations analogous to the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model.\\nWe integrated the flood contagion model with the network percolation process in\\nwhich the probability of flooding of a road segment depends on the degree to\\nwhich the nearby road segments are flooded. The application of the proposed\\nmodel was verified using high-resolution historical data of road flooding in\\nHarris County during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The results show that the model\\ncan monitor and predict the fraction of flooded roads over time. Additionally,\\nthe proposed model can achieve $90\\\\%$ precision and recall for the spatial\\nspread of the flooded roads at the majority of tested time intervals. The\\nfindings suggest that the proposed mathematical contagion model offers great\\npotential to support emergency managers, public officials, citizens, first\\nresponders, and other decision makers for flood forecast in road networks.","text_path":"SEIR_paper.txt","download_failure":"","search_string":"flash flood"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10312v1":{"publish_dt":"2019-08-23 20:50:14+00:00","title":"Physics Informed Data Driven model for Flood Prediction: Application of Deep Learning in prediction of urban flood development","authors":["Kun Qian","Abduallah Mohamed","Christian Claudel"],"categories":["eess.SP","cs.LG"],"abstract":"Flash floods in urban areas occur with increasing frequency.

Unlike prior works that largely focus on a single component of the\\nbug reports, our approach takes into account the textual data, bug fixing\\ncosts, and bug dependencies. We further incorporate the schedule of developers\\nin our formulation to have a more comprehensive model for this multifaceted\\nproblem. As a result, this complete formulation considers developers\' schedules\\nand the blocking effects of the bugs while covering the most significant\\naspects of the previously proposed methods. Our numerical study on four\\nopen-source software systems, namely, EclipseJDT, LibreOffice, GCC, and\\nMozilla, shows that taking into account the schedules of the developers\\ndecreases the average bug fixing times. We find that S-DABT leads to a high\\nlevel of developer utilization through a fair distribution of the tasks among\\nthe developers and efficient use of the free spots in their schedules. Via the\\nsimulation of the issue tracking system, we also show how incorporating the\\nschedule in the model formulation reduces the bug fixing time, improves the\\nassignment accuracy, and utilizes the capability of each developer without much\\ncomprising in the model run times. We find that S-DABT decreases the complexity\\nof the bug dependency graph by prioritizing blocking bugs and effectively\\nreduces the infeasible assignment ratio due to bug dependencies. Consequently,\\nwe recommend considering developers\' schedules while automating bug triage.","text_path":"Main.txt","download_failure":"","search_string":"bug"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4092v3":{"publish_dt":"2010-10-20 03:08:09+00:00","title":"Predicting Bugs\' Components via Mining Bug Reports","authors":["Deqing Wang","Hui Zhang","Rui Liu","Mengxiang Lin","Wenjun Wu","Hongping Hu"],"categories":["cs.SE"],"abstract":"The number of bug reports in complex software increases dramatically.

In this study, we take advantage of the uniquely valuable\\nTaiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and conduct a\\npan-disease analysis of period prevalence trend. The goal is to identify\\nclusters within which diseases share similar period prevalence trends. For this\\npurpose, a novel penalization pursuit approach is developed, which has an\\nintuitive formulation and satisfactory properties. In data analysis, the period\\nprevalence values are computed using records on close to 1 million subjects and\\n14 years of observation. For 405 diseases, 35 nontrivial clusters (with sizes\\nlarger than one) and 27 trivial clusters (with sizes one) are identified. The\\nresults differ significantly from those of the alternatives. A closer\\nexamination suggests that the clustering results have sound interpretations.\\nThis study is the first to conduct a pan-disease clustering analysis of\\nprevalence trend using the uniquely valuable NHIRD data and can have important\\nvalue in multiple aspects.","text_path":"2018-08-03.txt","download_failure":"","search_string":"disease"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03746v1":{"publish_dt":"2020-10-08 03:14:38+00:00","title":"Infusing Disease Knowledge into BERT for Health Question Answering, Medical Inference and Disease Name Recognition","authors":["Yun He","Ziwei Zhu","Yin Zhang","Qin Chen","James Caverlee"],"categories":["cs.CL","I.2.7"],"abstract":"Knowledge of a disease includes information of various aspects of the\\ndisease, such as signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment.

Deep belief networks (DBN)\\nare recently used in biological network analysis to learn the latent\\nrepresentations of network features.\\n  Method: In this paper, we propose a DBN based lncRNA-disease association\\nprediction model (DBNLDA) from lncRNA, disease and miRNA interactions. The\\narchitecture contains three major modules-network construction, DBN based\\nfeature learning and neural network-based prediction. First, we constructed\\nthree heterogeneous networks such as lncRNA-miRNA similarity (LMS),\\ndisease-miRNA similarity (DMS) and lncRNA-disease association (LDA) network.\\nFrom the node embedding matrices of similarity networks, lncRNA-disease\\nrepresentations were learned separately by two DBN based subnetworks. The joint\\nrepresentation of lncRNA-disease was learned by a third DBN from outputs of the\\ntwo subnetworks mentioned. This joint feature representation was used to\\npredict the association score by an ANN classifier.\\n  Result: The proposed method obtained AUC of 0.96 and AUPR of 0.967 when\\ntested against standard dataset used by the state-of-the-art methods. Analysis\\non breast, lung and stomach cancer cases also affirmed the effectiveness of\\nDBNLDA in predicting significant lncRNA-disease associations.","text_path":"dbnlda.txt","download_failure":"","search_string":"disease"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08300v1":{"publish_dt":"2020-10-16 10:46:28+00:00","title":"Interpretable Disease Prediction based on Reinforcement Path Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs","authors":["Zhoujian Sun","Wei Dong","Jinlong Shi","Zhengxing Huang"],"categories":["cs.LG","cs.AI","cs.IR"],"abstract":"Objective: To combine medical knowledge and medical data to interpretably\\npredict the risk of disease.

However powerful they are, though, such\\nsurveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil\\nproperties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with\\nthe widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be\\ndistorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such\\nsurveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure\\ntime series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series\\ncannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical\\nand geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of\\nthe duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a\\ndistribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the\\nunderlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a\\nscheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey\\nusing data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil\\noccurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our\\nresults to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five\\nlow-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.","text_path":"","download_failure":"Download Failure","search_string":"dust"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02886v1":{"publish_dt":"2019-01-09 15:21:00+00:00","title":"Dust scaling relations in a cosmological simulation","authors":["Kuan-Chou Hou","Shohei Aoyama","Hiroyuki Hirashita","Kentaro Nagamine","Ikkoh Shimizu"],"categories":["astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.CO"],"abstract":"To study the dust evolution in the cosmological structure formation history,\\nwe perform a smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulation with a dust enrichment\\nmodel in a cosmological volume.

The model accounts for dust sublimation, radiative transfer with the\\nflux-limited diffusion approximation and dust diffusion. It predicts the\\ndensity and temperature profiles as well as the dust-to-gas ratio of the disk.\\nResults. It is shown that dust diffusion can have a large impact: assuming the\\ndust survives for 104 seconds or longer before it can be evaporated, leads the\\ndust diffusion to widen the inner disk considerably. The latter effect is\\ngenerated through a feedback mechanism as the diffusion length is much smaller\\nthan the disk width.

Assuming L=10^c Vmax^a R^b, c being a scaling factor, the\\ncoefficients, a and b, generally range between 4-12 and 2-4, respectively. Both\\na and b tend to increase with stronger wind speed. For large losses, a weighted\\nregression model, with a being 4.28 and b being 2.52, produces a reasonable\\nfitting to the actual losses. Hurricane Sandy\'s size was about 3.4 times of the\\naverage size of the 73 storms analyzed. Based on the weighted regression model,\\nHurricane Sandy\'s loss would be 21 times smaller if its size were of the\\naverage size with maximum wind speed unchanged. It is important to revise\\nconventional empirical hurricane loss models to include both maximum wind speed\\nand size as predictors.","text_path":"","download_failure":"Download Failure","search_string":"hurricane"},"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03497v1":{"publish_dt":"2021-05-07 20:36:52+00:00","title":"Probabilistic Modeling of Hurricane Wind-Induced Damage in Infrastructure Systems","authors":["Derek Chang","Kerry Emanuel","Saurabh Amin"],"categories":["stat.AP","stat.OT"],"abstract":"This paper presents a modeling approach for probabilistic estimation of\\nhurricane wind-induced damage to infrastructural assets.

This study uses a\\nsuite of analytically based simulations to investigate the dynamical response\\nwhen stars are subject to cold torquing and are also resonant with an\\nultraharmonic.
